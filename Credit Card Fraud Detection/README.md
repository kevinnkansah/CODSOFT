# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Deployment of the best performing model to detect fraud in real-time transactions.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of X% in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry, and machine learning models can be effective in identifying fraudulent activity.
