# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Deployment of the best performing model to predict survival on new data.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting survival on the Titanic.

## Conclusion
The Titanic survival prediction project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in making predictions on historical data. Further analysis and exploration can be done to improve the model's performance and accuracy.
