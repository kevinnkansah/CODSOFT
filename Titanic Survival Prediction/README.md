# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Approach
- Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones using One Hot Encoder, Simple Imputer and Column Transformer.
- Model training using logistic regression.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of 81.006 % in predicting survival on the Titanic.

## Conclusion
The Titanic survival prediction project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in making predictions on historical data. Further analysis and exploration can be done to improve the model's performance and accuracy.
