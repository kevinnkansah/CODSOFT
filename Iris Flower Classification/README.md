# Iris Flower Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to classify the species of iris flowers using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of the sepal and petal lengths and widths for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Approach
- Model training using random forest.
- Model evaluation using a confusion matrix.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of 100% in classifying the species of iris flowers.

## Conclusion
The Iris flower classification project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in solving real-world classification problems.
