# Iris Flower Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to classify the species of iris flowers using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of the sepal and petal lengths and widths for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Deployment of the best performing model to classify new iris flowers.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of X% in classifying the species of iris flowers.

## Conclusion
The Iris flower classification project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in solving real-world classification problems. Further analysis and exploration can be done to improve the model's performance and accuracy.
